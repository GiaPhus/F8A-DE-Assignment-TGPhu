<details - open>
<summary>Batch ingestion setup using Data Fusion, GCS, and BigQuery</summary>

---

- **Enable APIs**:
  - Activate the following APIs on GCP: Cloud Data Fusion, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and optionally IAM for access management.

- **Create GCS Bucket**:
  - Navigate to GCS → create a new bucket (`a06-batch-data` or similar).
  - Choose the same region as your Data Fusion instance.
  - Set access controls depending on project scope (fine-grained or uniform).

- **Prepare Sample Data**:
  - Upload a `.csv` or `.json` file to a subfolder in your bucket (e.g., `a06-batch-data/source1/data.csv`).

- **Deploy Data Fusion Instance**:
  - Go to Data Fusion → create instance (`basic` edition is sufficient).
  - Choose the same region as GCS and BigQuery to avoid egress costs.
  - Wait for the instance to become available (status: `RUNNING`).

- **Design Batch Pipeline**:
  - Open the instance → go to `Wrangler` or `Studio`.
  - Source: GCS → specify path to uploaded file.
  - Optional: Add transformation nodes like Wrangler or Expression Evaluator.
  - Sink: BigQuery → select or create dataset/table.
  - Choose “Create External Table” if you want speed; “Ingest to Native Table” if you want direct loading.

- **Run and Monitor**:
  - Deploy the pipeline.
  - Trigger a manual run (or schedule if required).
  - Monitor in Cloud Data Fusion UI or through GCP Logging.

- **Validation**:
  - Go to BigQuery → query the table to verify records loaded correctly.

### Prompt: "Streaming ingestion setup (Pub/Sub setup, Create table BQ, Dataflow Streaming Job...)"
<details - open>
<summary>Streaming ingestion setup using Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and BigQuery</summary>

---

- **Enable APIs**:
  - Ensure Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and BigQuery APIs are enabled for the project.

- **Create Pub/Sub Topic**:
  - Go to Pub/Sub → create a new topic (e.g., `a06-realtime-events`).
  - You can create a subscription later or let Dataflow handle it.

- **Create BigQuery Table**:
  - Go to BigQuery → create a dataset (e.g., `a06_streaming_ds`).
  - Inside the dataset, create a **native table** (e.g., `streamed_events`) with schema matching the streaming messages.
  - If using JSON messages, align fields accordingly.

- **Build Streaming Pipeline with Dataflow**:
  - Use Dataflow templates or custom jobs (in Java/Python via Apache Beam).
  - For quick setup, use the "Pub/Sub to BigQuery" template:
    - Go to Dataflow → "Create Job from Template"
    - Template: `Pub/Sub Subscription to BigQuery`
    - Input: Pub/Sub topic or subscription
    - Output Table: `project_id:a06_streaming_ds.streamed_events`

- **Run and Monitor the Job**:
  - Launch the job.
  - Go to Dataflow dashboard to monitor pipeline health, throughput, and latency.

- **Test the Setup**:
  - Publish test messages to the Pub/Sub topic using `gcloud` or the Pub/Sub UI.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    gcloud pubsub topics publish a06-realtime-events --message='{"event_id": "1", "type": "click"}'
    ```
  - Query the BigQuery table to confirm data arrival.

- **Optional Enhancements**:
  - Add transformation logic with Apache Beam (e.g., timestamp parsing, deduplication).
  - Integrate with Looker Studio for real-time dashboards.

### Prompt: "Chi tiết hóa Bronze, Silver, Gold layer cho transformation và modeling"
<details - open>
<summary>Multi-layered transformation plan after batch & streaming ingestion</summary>

---

#### Bronze Layer – Raw Ingested Data

- **Objective**: Persist raw data as-is from ingestion sources.
- **Batch**:
  - Data landed in **GCS** by **Data Fusion**.
  - Registered as **external tables** in **BigQuery** using file paths.
- **Streaming**:
  - Real-time data from **Pub/Sub → Dataflow** inserted into **BigQuery native tables**.
  - Tables should be **partitioned by ingestion time** and optionally clustered by entity IDs.

- **Tools**:
  - **Data Fusion** (batch), **Dataflow** (streaming)
  - **BigQuery External Table** (batch)
  - **BigQuery Native Table** (streaming)

- **Schema Strategy**:
  - Maintain loose schema at this stage.
  - Avoid enforcing types too early—keep semi-structured formats like `JSON` for flexibility.

---

#### Silver Layer – Cleaned & Structured Data

- **Objective**: Standardize schema, perform initial transformations, type casting, and de-duplication.
- **Batch**:
  - Use **CTAS** (Create Table As Select) or **scheduled queries** to create native BigQuery tables.
  - Clean using **BigQuery SQL**, **Spark on Dataproc**, or **DataPrep** if available.
- **Streaming**:
  - Use **materialized views** or **scheduled queries** to clean streaming data.
  - Partition output tables for performance (e.g., by `event_date` or `user_id`).

- **Transformations**:
  - Parse `JSON` payloads into structured columns.
  - Enrich with reference data (e.g., dimension tables in BigQuery).
  - Remove duplicates via `ROW_NUMBER()` or `ARRAY_AGG` de-dupe logic.

- **Tools**:
  - **BigQuery SQL** (primary)
  - **Trino** (if warehouse-agnostic and no cost impact)
  - **Spark** (if cleaning is complex or needs distributed processing)

---

#### Gold Layer – Business-Facing Models

- **Objective**: Serve reporting needs with curated, aggregated tables.
- **Transformations**:
  - Compute KPIs, metrics, and aggregates.
  - Build dimensional models like `fact_sales`, `dim_customer`, `fact_events`.
  - Include business logic like status mappings, calculated fields.

- **Batch**:
  - Use **DBT** or **modular SQL** for transformation pipelines.
  - Schedule jobs to refresh Gold tables daily or hourly.
- **Streaming**:
  - Use **materialized views** with smart refresh settings.
  - If latency is critical, use **streaming inserts** into pre-aggregated tables.

- **Tools**:
  - **BigQuery SQL**, **DBT (modular, version-controlled)**
  - **Looker Studio** to visualize directly from Gold tables
  - Optional: **Dataform** or **Cloud Composer** for orchestration

---

#### Notes on Tooling Evolution

- Start with **BigQuery SQL** for all transformations.
- Once the modeling logic stabilizes, **migrate to DBT** for:
  - Reusability
  - Modularity
  - Testing and documentation
- DBT structure recommendation:
  - `staging/` → Silver layer
  - `marts/` → Gold layer
  - `sources/` → Bronze definitions

### Prompt: "Design a Migration Plan from a temporary architecture to a production-ready pipeline with versioning, testing, CI/CD, and DBT transformations"

<details open>
<summary>Refactor pipeline from temporary setup (Fusion, CTAS, Looker Studio) to production-grade architecture using Airflow + DBT + BigQuery</summary>

---

#### 🟠 Temporary Architecture Overview

- **Batch Ingestion**:  
  - Data Sources (API/File) → **Cloud Data Fusion** → GCS → External Table → CTAS to create native BigQuery tables (Silver/Gold)
- **Streaming Ingestion**:  
  - Pub/Sub → Dataflow → BigQuery native table
- **Data Warehouse**: BigQuery
- **Dashboard**: Looker Studio connected directly to BigQuery

**Limitations of the Temporary Setup:**
- **Cloud Data Fusion** lacks version control, testing capabilities, and is hard to debug or customize.
- Using **CTAS directly** in BigQuery leads to unmodularized SQL, hard to test or reuse.
- No **schema validation**, **data lineage**, or formal testing process.
- Dashboards rely on live querying without performance tuning or semantic modeling.

**Tôi nghĩ nên chuyển Fusion thành Airflow** để dễ dàng kiểm soát pipeline, customize logic, và tích hợp CI/CD.

---

#### ✅ Migration Goals

- **Replace Fusion with Airflow (or Cloud Composer)**:  
  - Customizable pipelines with Python.
  - Enables modular DAGs, testing, alerting, and orchestration.
- **Streaming Layer Enhancements**:  
  - Keep Pub/Sub → Dataflow but add:
    - Schema control with validation logic.
    - Dead-letter queues (DLQ) and monitoring via Stackdriver or OpenTelemetry.
- **Data Transformation via DBT**:
  - Organize into **Bronze → Silver → Gold** layers.
  - Modular SQL with `staging/`, `intermediate/`, and `marts/` folders.
  - Supports testing (`dbt test`), schema validation, documentation (`dbt docs`).
- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - Use GitHub Actions or Cloud Build for:
    - DBT model testing
    - Deployment to production
    - Code versioning and rollback
- **Dashboard Upgrade**:
  - Option 1: Keep **Looker Studio** temporarily if acceptable.
  - Option 2: Migrate to **Looker** with LookML for:
    - Reusable semantic models
    - Access control
    - Governed metrics layer
- **Governance & Monitoring**:
  - Add **dbt docs**, **BigQuery schema registry**, and metadata tagging.
  - Monitor pipelines via **Airflow logs**, **dbt test results**, **BQ job history**.

---

#### 🔁 Final Architecture Highlights

- **Ingestion**:
  - Batch: API/File → Airflow DAG → GCS/BigQuery Raw
  - Streaming: Pub/Sub → Dataflow → BQ (with schema validation)

- **Transformation**:
  - All modeling handled by **DBT** (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
  - Scheduled runs via **Airflow**

- **Warehouse**:
  - Stay with **BigQuery** as the main warehouse due to:
    - Serverless architecture
    - Seamless integration with GCP ecosystem
    - Support for materialized views and partitions

- **Visualization**:
  - Directly connect **Looker/Looker Studio** to Gold tables
  - Use partitioned/mart-level tables for efficient dashboarding

---

This migration plan ensures modularity, observability, and scalability across the full data pipeline lifecycle.
