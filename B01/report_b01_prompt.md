### Prompt: "Write the Overview section for a report on a Vector DB Tutorial, summarizing what the test is about, the requirements, and the intended goals."

<details - open>  
<summary>Clarify test objectives and generate the Overview section for report_b01.md</summary>  
---

- **Context**:
  - The candidate is completing Task B01 from a technical writing assessment focused on vector databases.
  - The purpose of the prompt was to create an Overview section that accurately reflects:
    - What the B01 test is
    - What the candidate is expected to deliver
    - What the tutorial should help the reader achieve

- **User Goal**:
  - Clearly summarize the purpose of the test task and tutorial in plain, professional English.
  - Ensure that the Overview matches the official deliverable requirements, including:
    - Concept introduction and definitions
    - Tool comparison
    - Deep dive into one selected vector database
    - Practical implementation guidance
    - Best practices for optimization and performance

- **GenAI Response (used in report)**:
  - A well-structured Overview that introduces the B01 task as a self-contained guide to vector database technologies.
  - Outlines the educational and documentation goals.
  - Emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and value for both technical and cross-functional teams.

### Prompt: "Viết phần ## Terminology để giải thích các khái niệm Vector, Embedding, ANN, Payload, Indexing, RAG, Collection, theo đúng style báo cáo ctx_doc_style.md"

<summary>Define and explain key theoretical terms used in vector database systems</summary>

- **Vector**  
  - A vector is a list of numerical values (usually floats) representing a data item in a multi-dimensional space.  
  - Vectors enable semantic comparison between unstructured data like text, images, and audio.  
  - Vector similarity is the foundation of search and retrieval in vector databases.

- **Embedding**  
  - Embedding is the process of converting raw data (e.g., text, image, audio) into vectors.  
  - It captures the semantic meaning of the input using machine learning models.  
  - Example: The sentences “I like tea” and “I enjoy hot drinks” will have similar embeddings.

- **ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)**  
  - ANN algorithms are used to efficiently search for vectors that are closest to a query vector.  
  - ANN is a trade-off between speed and accuracy, optimized for large-scale datasets.  
  - Common ANN algorithms: HNSW, IVF, ScaNN, LSH.

- **Payload**  
  - A payload is the metadata associated with a vector in a vector database.  
  - It contains human-readable information like `title`, `tags`, `timestamp`, etc.  
  - Payloads are used for filtering, hybrid search, and data enrichment.

- **Indexing**  
  - Indexing is the process of organizing vectors to allow fast and efficient search.  
  - Vector DBs support different index types (e.g., HNSW, Flat) for different use cases.  
  - Proper indexing improves query speed and memory efficiency.

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  - RAG is an AI architecture that combines information retrieval and text generation.  
  - The retrieval module (e.g., vector DB) finds relevant content based on the input query.  
  - The generation module (e.g., LLM) uses the retrieved content to generate contextual answers.  
  - RAG is used in AI assistants, knowledge bots, and enterprise search.

- **Collection**  
  - A collection is a logical container or namespace in a vector database.  
  - Each collection holds a group of vectors and their payloads.  
  - Similar to a “table” in relational databases or an “index” in Elasticsearch.

### Prompt: "Make 'Embedding' a dedicated section and add a sentence explaining that embedding helps digitize images, text, and audio to understand their relationships."

<details - open>  
<summary>Rewrite and expand the Embedding definition with digitization explanation</summary>  
---

- **Embedding** is the process of converting raw data (e.g., text, image, audio) into numerical vectors.  
- It allows machines to **capture the semantic meaning** of the input using pre-trained or fine-tuned machine learning models.  
- For example, the sentences “I like tea” and “I enjoy hot drinks” will have similar embeddings, reflecting their semantic similarity.  
- To understand **relationships between text, images, and audio**, these formats must first be **digitized** — embedding enables this transformation.  
- Embeddings are essential for tasks such as **semantic search**, **recommendation systems**, **multi-modal AI**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.
