### Prompt: "Viết phần ## Terminology để giải thích các khái niệm Vector, Embedding, ANN, Payload, Indexing, RAG, Collection, theo đúng style báo cáo ctx_doc_style.md"

<details - open>  
<summary>Define and explain key theoretical terms used in vector database systems</summary>  
---

- **Vector**  
  - A vector is a list of numerical values (usually floats) representing a data item in a multi-dimensional space.  
  - Vectors enable semantic comparison between unstructured data like text, images, and audio.  
  - Vector similarity is the foundation of search and retrieval in vector databases.

- **Embedding**  
  - Embedding is the process of converting raw data (e.g., text, image, audio) into vectors.  
  - It captures the semantic meaning of the input using machine learning models.  
  - Example: The sentences “I like tea” and “I enjoy hot drinks” will have similar embeddings.

- **ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)**  
  - ANN algorithms are used to efficiently search for vectors that are closest to a query vector.  
  - ANN is a trade-off between speed and accuracy, optimized for large-scale datasets.  
  - Common ANN algorithms: HNSW, IVF, ScaNN, LSH.

- **Payload**  
  - A payload is the metadata associated with a vector in a vector database.  
  - It contains human-readable information like `title`, `tags`, `timestamp`, etc.  
  - Payloads are used for filtering, hybrid search, and data enrichment.

- **Indexing**  
  - Indexing is the process of organizing vectors to allow fast and efficient search.  
  - Vector DBs support different index types (e.g., HNSW, Flat) for different use cases.  
  - Proper indexing improves query speed and memory efficiency.

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  - RAG is an AI architecture that combines information retrieval and text generation.  
  - The retrieval module (e.g., vector DB) finds relevant content based on the input query.  
  - The generation module (e.g., LLM) uses the retrieved content to generate contextual answers.  
  - RAG is used in AI assistants, knowledge bots, and enterprise search.

- **Collection**  
  - A collection is a logical container or namespace in a vector database.  
  - Each collection holds a group of vectors and their payloads.  
  - Similar to a “table” in relational databases or an “index” in Elasticsearch.

### Prompt: "Make 'Embedding' a dedicated section and add a sentence explaining that embedding helps digitize images, text, and audio to understand their relationships."

<details - open>  
<summary>Rewrite and expand the Embedding definition with digitization explanation</summary>  
---

- **Embedding** is the process of converting raw data (e.g., text, image, audio) into numerical vectors.  
- It allows machines to **capture the semantic meaning** of the input using pre-trained or fine-tuned machine learning models.  
- For example, the sentences “I like tea” and “I enjoy hot drinks” will have similar embeddings, reflecting their semantic similarity.  
- To understand **relationships between text, images, and audio**, these formats must first be **digitized** — embedding enables this transformation.  
- Embeddings are essential for tasks such as **semantic search**, **recommendation systems**, **multi-modal AI**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.

### Prompt: "Write the ## Introduction to Vector Databases section to explain the concept, motivation, and core characteristics of vector databases."

<details - open>  
<summary>Generate introductory explanation of vector databases and their importance</summary>  
---

- A **Vector Database** is a specialized system designed to store, manage, and search high-dimensional vectors.  
- These vectors typically represent **unstructured data** such as text, images, or audio, encoded using **embedding models**.  
- Unlike traditional databases that match **keywords**, vector DBs perform **semantic similarity search** — retrieving content with similar *meaning*, not just matching words.  
- It supports **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** search for efficient large-scale retrieval.

#### Why Vector Databases Matter

- The rise of unstructured data requires new techniques for meaningful retrieval.  
- Vector DBs power modern applications like:
  - **Semantic search engines**
  - **Recommendation systems**
  - **AI assistants and chatbots** (via RAG)
  - **Image/audio similarity search**

#### Core Characteristics

- Store billions of vectors efficiently with fast indexing.
- Support hybrid filtering using metadata (payloads).
- Integrate with AI/ML workflows and embedding pipelines.
- Scale horizontally and offer high throughput for real-time applications.

### Prompt: "Add a real-world example to show how vector search works using a question like 'How to cook beef pho?'"

<details - open>  
<summary>Add real-world example of semantic retrieval using beef pho</summary>  
---

- Instead of matching exact keywords, vector DBs compare the *meaning* of your query:  
  - Input question: **"How to cook beef pho?"**  
    - → is embedded as a vector: `[0.12, 0.45, 0.89, ...]`  
  - System finds documents with similar vectors, like:
    - “Traditional Pho Recipe at Home”
    - “Tips for Rich Pho Broth”  
  - It ignores unrelated content like:
    - “How to Make Pizza”  
- This enables much **smarter, intent-based retrieval** than keyword matching.
