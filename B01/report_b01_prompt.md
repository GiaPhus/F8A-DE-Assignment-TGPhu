### Prompt: "Viết phần ## Terminology để giải thích các khái niệm Vector, Embedding, ANN, Payload, Indexing, RAG, Collection, theo đúng style báo cáo ctx_doc_style.md"

<details - open>  
<summary>Define and explain key theoretical terms used in vector database systems</summary>  
---

- **Vector**  
  - A vector is a list of numerical values (usually floats) representing a data item in a multi-dimensional space.  
  - Vectors enable semantic comparison between unstructured data like text, images, and audio.  
  - Vector similarity is the foundation of search and retrieval in vector databases.

- **Embedding**  
  - Embedding is the process of converting raw data (e.g., text, image, audio) into vectors.  
  - It captures the semantic meaning of the input using machine learning models.  
  - Example: The sentences “I like tea” and “I enjoy hot drinks” will have similar embeddings.

- **ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)**  
  - ANN algorithms are used to efficiently search for vectors that are closest to a query vector.  
  - ANN is a trade-off between speed and accuracy, optimized for large-scale datasets.  
  - Common ANN algorithms: HNSW, IVF, ScaNN, LSH.

- **Payload**  
  - A payload is the metadata associated with a vector in a vector database.  
  - It contains human-readable information like `title`, `tags`, `timestamp`, etc.  
  - Payloads are used for filtering, hybrid search, and data enrichment.

- **Indexing**  
  - Indexing is the process of organizing vectors to allow fast and efficient search.  
  - Vector DBs support different index types (e.g., HNSW, Flat) for different use cases.  
  - Proper indexing improves query speed and memory efficiency.

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  - RAG is an AI architecture that combines information retrieval and text generation.  
  - The retrieval module (e.g., vector DB) finds relevant content based on the input query.  
  - The generation module (e.g., LLM) uses the retrieved content to generate contextual answers.  
  - RAG is used in AI assistants, knowledge bots, and enterprise search.

- **Collection**  
  - A collection is a logical container or namespace in a vector database.  
  - Each collection holds a group of vectors and their payloads.  
  - Similar to a “table” in relational databases or an “index” in Elasticsearch.

### Prompt: "Make 'Embedding' a dedicated section and add a sentence explaining that embedding helps digitize images, text, and audio to understand their relationships."

<details - open>  
<summary>Rewrite and expand the Embedding definition with digitization explanation</summary>  
---

- **Embedding** is the process of converting raw data (e.g., text, image, audio) into numerical vectors.  
- It allows machines to **capture the semantic meaning** of the input using pre-trained or fine-tuned machine learning models.  
- For example, the sentences “I like tea” and “I enjoy hot drinks” will have similar embeddings, reflecting their semantic similarity.  
- To understand **relationships between text, images, and audio**, these formats must first be **digitized** — embedding enables this transformation.  
- Embeddings are essential for tasks such as **semantic search**, **recommendation systems**, **multi-modal AI**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.

</details>

### Prompt: "Write the ## Introduction to Vector Databases section to explain the concept, motivation, and core characteristics of vector databases."

<details - open>  
<summary>Generate introductory explanation of vector databases and their importance</summary>  
---

- A **Vector Database** is a specialized system designed to store, manage, and search high-dimensional vectors.  
- These vectors typically represent **unstructured data** such as text, images, or audio, encoded using **embedding models**.  
- Unlike traditional databases that match **keywords**, vector DBs perform **semantic similarity search** — retrieving content with similar *meaning*, not just matching words.  
- It supports **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** search for efficient large-scale retrieval.

#### Why Vector Databases Matter

- The rise of unstructured data requires new techniques for meaningful retrieval.  
- Vector DBs power modern applications like:
  - **Semantic search engines**
  - **Recommendation systems**
  - **AI assistants and chatbots** (via RAG)
  - **Image/audio similarity search**

#### Core Characteristics

- Store billions of vectors efficiently with fast indexing.
- Support hybrid filtering using metadata (payloads).
- Integrate with AI/ML workflows and embedding pipelines.
- Scale horizontally and offer high throughput for real-time applications.

### Prompt: "Add a real-world example to show how vector search works using a question like 'How to cook beef pho?'"

<details - open>  
<summary>Add real-world example of semantic retrieval using beef pho</summary>  
---

- Instead of matching exact keywords, vector DBs compare the *meaning* of your query:  
  - Input question: **"How to cook beef pho?"**  
    - → is embedded as a vector: `[0.12, 0.45, 0.89, ...]`  
  - System finds documents with similar vectors, like:
    - “Traditional Pho Recipe at Home”
    - “Tips for Rich Pho Broth”  
  - It ignores unrelated content like:
    - “How to Make Pizza”  
- This enables much **smarter, intent-based retrieval** than keyword matching.

</details>

### Docker Compose
<details - open>  
<summary>Using Docker Compose for Qdrant Deployment</summary>  

---

- **Docker Compose** allows you to define and manage multi-container applications with a declarative YAML file.  
- It is especially useful in development environments for:
  - Running Qdrant with consistent, repeatable configurations
  - Organizing service settings, ports, and volumes clearly
  - Automatically restarting the container upon failure
  - Simplifying setup without manual command repetition

- Below is a working `docker-compose.yml` example for launching a **single-node Qdrant instance**:  
  - The configuration uses the `configs:` block to inline the YAML settings directly
  - Ensure you're using **Docker Compose v2.23.1+** and **Docker Engine v25.0.0+** to support inline config
  - Data is persisted through a `volume` mounted to `./qdrant_data`

```yaml
services:
  qdrant:
    image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
    restart: always
    container_name: qdrant
    ports:
      - 6333:6333
      - 6334:6334
    expose:
      - 6333
      - 6334
      - 6335
    configs:
      - source: qdrant_config
        target: /qdrant/config/production.yaml
    volumes:
      - ./qdrant_data:/qdrant/storage

configs:
  qdrant_config:
    content: |
      log_level: INFO
```


### Prompt: I wanted to set up the environment with Qdrant, so I asked what services are needed besides Docker Compose (like notebooks)
<details open>
<summary>System setup with Qdrant and additional tools</summary>

---
- **GenAI Answer:**
  - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with services for:
    - `qdrant`: vector database
    - `notebook`: Jupyter for experimentation
    - `streamlit`: frontend GUI for interactive search
  - Also prepare `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and working directories.
</details>

---

### Prompt: I requested a requirements.txt file and Dockerfile to build the working environment
<details open>
<summary>Dependencies and build image definition</summary>

---
- **GenAI Answer:**
  - `requirements.txt` includes `qdrant-client`, `streamlit`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `plotly`
  - `Dockerfile` uses `jupyter/all-spark-notebook` as base image, installs required packages, sets working directory
</details>

---

### Prompt: I mentioned we should add Streamlit because we'll build a GUI later
<details open>
<summary>Include Streamlit for user interface</summary>

---
- **GenAI Answer:**
  - Add `streamlit` to `requirements.txt`
  - Add `streamlit` service to `docker-compose.yml`
  - Mount volumes so it can access both app and datasets
</details>

---

### Prompt: I shared the schema of the dataset and asked how to build the recommendation system based on it
<details open>
<summary>Schema-based approach to recommendation logic</summary>

---
- **GenAI Answer:**
  - Use the second table (audio features) to form vectors for Qdrant
  - Upload metadata separately to keep UI clean
  - Use `track_id` as key to map between metadata and vector store
  - Start from creating the collection, then embed, then build GUI to search and recommend
</details>

### Prompt: I suggested writing `search_by_name(name)` using `meta_df[meta_df["track_name"].str.contains(name, case=False)]`
<details open>
<summary>Search logic based on track name keyword</summary>

---
- **GenAI Answer:**
  - That's a good approach. Here's a wrapped version of your idea into a reusable function:

```python
def search_by_name(name):
    """Search for track name matching query"""
    return meta_df[meta_df["track_name"].str.contains(name, case=False)]
```

</details>

---

### Prompt: I suggested `search_similar_tracks(track_id, k=5)` by getting the audio vector from `audio_df`, then search in Qdrant, and exclude itself
<details open>
<summary>Finding top-k similar tracks using vector similarity</summary>

---
- **GenAI Answer:**
  - Right. Here's how to turn that logic into a full function:

```python
def search_similar_tracks(track_id, k=5):
    matched = audio_df[audio_df["track_id"] == track_id]
    if matched.empty:
        raise ValueError(f"Track ID {track_id} not found in audio features data.")
    
    vector = matched["vector"].values[0]

    results = client.search(
        collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
        query_vector=vector,
        limit=k + 1  # include original
    )
    return [
        r.payload["track_id"]
        for r in results
        if r.payload["track_id"] != track_id
    ][:k]
```

</details>

---

### Prompt: I proposed creating `show_radar_chart()` using Plotly radar chart to visualize vector
<details open>
<summary>Display song features on a radar plot</summary>

---
- **GenAI Answer:**
  - Agreed. Here's how to implement it with Plotly and Streamlit:

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import streamlit as st

def show_radar_chart(vector, labels):
    """Display radar chart of audio features"""
    fig = go.Figure()
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatterpolar(
        r=vector.tolist() + [vector[0]],
        theta=labels + [labels[0]],
        fill='toself',
        name='Audio Profile'
    ))
    fig.update_layout(
        polar=dict(radialaxis=dict(visible=True)),
        showlegend=False
    )
    st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
```

</details>

---

### Prompt: I proposed adding a section in the Streamlit app to show the audio feature vector when a track is selected
<details open>
<summary>Display vector values when a user selects a track</summary>

---
- **GenAI Answer:**
  - Here's how you can add that in the Streamlit `app.py`, under the "Now Playing" section:

```python
selected_vector = audio_df[audio_df["track_id"] == track_id][VECTOR_COLS].values[0]
st.json(dict(zip(VECTOR_COLS, selected_vector)))
show_radar_chart(selected_vector, VECTOR_COLS)
```
